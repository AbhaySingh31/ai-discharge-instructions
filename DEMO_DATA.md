## Testing the AI System

### Step 1: Create Patients
Use the sample patient data above to create test patients in the system.

### Step 2: Add Medical Records
Add the corresponding medical records for each patient.

### Step 3: Add Discharge Notes
Create discharge notes using the sample data provided.

### Step 4: Generate AI Instructions
Once you have complete patient data, use the AI system to generate personalized discharge instructions.

### Step 5: Test Q&A System
Try asking questions like:
- "When can I drive again?"
- "What should I do if I have chest pain?"
- "How much weight can I lift?"
- "When should I call my doctor?"
- "What foods should I avoid?"

## Expected AI Output Examples

### For John Smith (Cardiac Surgery)
The AI should generate instructions covering:
- Detailed medication schedule with timing
- Cardiac diet recommendations
- Activity restrictions specific to cardiac surgery
- Warning signs for cardiac complications
- Follow-up appointment reminders
- Wound care for sternotomy incision

### For Sarah Johnson (Knee Surgery)
The AI should generate instructions covering:
- Pain management schedule
- Physical therapy exercises
- Weight-bearing restrictions
- Ice and elevation instructions
- Warning signs for infection or blood clots
- Follow-up care timeline

## Additional Test Scenarios

### Complex Patient
Create a patient with multiple conditions:
- Diabetes + Heart Disease + Kidney Disease
- Multiple allergies
- Complex medication regimen
- Multiple procedures

### Pediatric Patient
Test with a younger patient:
- Different age-appropriate language
- Parent/guardian instructions
- Pediatric-specific warnings

### Elderly Patient
Test with an older adult:
- Simplified instructions
- Fall prevention
- Medication management considerations

## API Testing

You can also test the API directly using tools like Postman or curl:

```bash
# Create a patient
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/patients/" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "patient_id": "P001234",
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Smith",
    "date_of_birth": "1965-03-15T00:00:00",
    "gender": "male",
    "phone": "(555) 123-4567"
  }'

# Generate instructions
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/generate-instructions/P001234?medical_record_id=1"

# Ask a question
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/ask-question/P001234?question=When%20can%20I%20drive%20again&medical_record_id=1"
```

This demo data will help you thoroughly test all features of the AI discharge instructions system and see how it generates personalized, patient-friendly instructions based on medical data.
